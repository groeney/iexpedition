              Voyages to the Canadian Arctic use remote ports, it is for this reason that all Canadian Arctic voyages require mandatory charter flights to arrive at the port. When considering these voyages, please do consider that charter rates are additional to the cost of the voyage and in some instances Canadian GST is payable. Our operators in this region use Edmonton, Ottawa and Montreal as their hubs.

             You will need to arrive in Edmonton, Ottawa or Montreal on day 1 of your expedition, as this will be a pre-cruise briefing day. The group will gather at the hotel provided by the ship and the following day travel together on the charter flight to meet the vessel at its location.
