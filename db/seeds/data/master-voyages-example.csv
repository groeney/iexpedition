Akademic Shokalskiy,East Antarctica: In the Wake of Mawson,Heritage Expeditions,USD,"Sir Douglas Mawson is arguably the grandfather of Antarctic science. The Australian Antarctic Expedition 1911-1914 is notable for its achievements and sadly its tragedies. 

Encouraged by the success of Shackleton’s 1908-09 Nimrod expedition, of which he was a member, Douglas Mawson planned his own expedition to explore the Antarctic coastline directly south of Australia. The Australasian Antarctic Expedition sailed from Hobart on 2 December 1911, making a brief stop at Macquarie Island to establish a radio base and then making landfall at Cape Denison in Commonwealth Bay. Unbeknownst to Mawson and his men, they had discovered the windiest place on the planet – renowned as the ‘home of the blizzard’. Tragedy struck the expedition when Ninnis and Mertz, the other two members of Mawson’s three-man Far Eastern Sledging Party, died. Mawson returned to base blinded by snow and having cheated death on more than one occasion. He made it back so late in the season that he had to overwinter in Antarctica as his relief ship had sailed. 

Mawson’s Hut at Cape Denison still stands; protected against the extreme weather for which the region is renowned. Cape Denison has historically been one of the very few ice free and readily accessible areas along the East Antarctic coastline. However when the Mertz Glacier tongue broke off in 2010 it blocked the annual movement of sea ice preventing any shipping and effectively isolating the area, we have been monitoring conditions in this region since and now see opportunities to return and explore this majestic, remote coastline.",08-Jan-18,02-Feb-18,Invercargill,Invercargill,Voyage to the remote and infrequently visited Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica.

Akademic Shokalskiy,Ross Sea: In the Wake of Scott & Shackleton,Heritage Expeditions,USD,"The Ross Sea region of Antarctica is one of the most remote places on Planet Earth and one of the most fascinating places in the continent’s human history.

Heritage Expeditions offers such a voyage on its own fully equipped and ice-strengthened ship, crewed by some of the most experienced officers and sailors in the world and staffed by some of the most passionate and knowledgeable Guides. This is a unique opportunity to experience nature on a scale so grand there are no words to describe it.

There is so much to do and so much to see here, from exploring historic huts and sites to visiting penguin rookeries, marvelling at the glacial ice tongues and ice shelves and understanding the icebergs and sea ice. Then there are all the seabirds, seals and whales to observe and photograph, modern scientific bases and field camps to visit and simply the opportunity to spend time drinking in the marvellous landscape that has always enthralled visitors.

Lying like stepping stones to the Antarctic continent are the little known Subantarctic Islands. Our journey includes The Snares, Aucklands, Macquarie and Campbell Island.

Bark Europa,Antarctic Peninsula,Bark Europa,USD,"The expeditions start in Argentina in Ushuaia, the southernmost city in South America, located alongside the Beagle Channel. From here, the ship must cross ‘the Drake Passage’, renowned by sailors the world over. Albatrosses and petrels will accompany the EUROPA on her way to the Antarctic paradise. After passing the Antarctic Convergence Zone, the ship sails between the icebergs to the South Shetland Islands. The wildlife is overwhelming: seals, sea-gulls, cormorants and petrels use the Antarctic summer to raise their young. In the Antarctic waters, the EUROPA will anchor in sheltered bays practically every day. The crew will take groups ashore in the dinghies to see glaciers, mosses and lichens, seals, birds and penguin rookeries. Ashore, visitors will often be welcomed by different kinds of penguins, such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Adelie penguins. Our experienced guide will give you information about the flora and fauna and will also tell you where to find bird and sea elephant colonies. The ship will sail further south. We expect the most loyal visitors of the Southern Ocean: enormous Humpback whales; Minke whales and even Orcas or Killer whales may well come close to us, curious to see who ventures into their waters. Ice masses will get bigger closer to the mainland. Steep glaciers, walls of ice with magical shapes and surreal colours will surround the EUROPA.",15-Jan-18,05-Feb-18,Ushuaia,Ushuaia,A unique experience on board the only tall ship undertaking expeditions to Antarctica,48,Expedition,FALSE,Antarctica,"Antarctic Peninsula, South Shetland Islands",0

Bark Europa,"Antarctica, South Georgia to Cape Town",Bark Europa,USD,"After leaving the Beagle Channel it is time to cross the Drake, visit the Antarctic Peninsula and depending on ice- and weather conditions the Weddellsea. The sails are hoisted for a serious sail to the beautiful island of South Georgia. We will spend about a week here and have a daily routine of moving the ship from one fjord to the other and make landings, enjoying the wildlife and hikes. We’ll find the remains of a former whaling station at Grytviken and see the grave of Shackleton, one of the most heroic pole travellers. It is an old tradition to drink a glass of whisky near his grave.

Heading back to sea course is set for Tristan da Cunha: the most remote island of the world. Here, in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, a small community lives on top of an active volcano. Let’s hope that the swell isn’t big enough to prevent a safe landing. On Tristan you can play golf on the most remote course of the planet or go fishing for lobster with the local fisherman. The final leg of this long voyage is a beautiful sail of about 10 days to Cape Town. Mid April the Table Mountain will appear on the horizon and the ship will be berthed along the quay in the V&A Waterfront.
