Antarctica 
The peak Antarctic tourism season runs from November through to March during the Austral summer.  During this time the wildlife is active, 24 hours of sunlight, temperatures allow for exploration however throughout the season Antarctic goes through a cycle of life:
Late October / Early November
Vast amounts of pristine fast moving ice, the temperature is slowly rising and daylight is slowly extending in time.  Expeditions at this time of the season focus on South Georgia and the birthing elephant seals; a marvel of mother nature and wildlife lovers dream.

November / Early December
As the ambient temperature starts to rise, you will still get a good pack ice and fast ice experience.  The sun is not yet providing 24 hours of daylight, providing wonderful light, perfect for wildlife photography.  Penguins are courting, fur seals give birth, minke and orca whales arrive and hunt. 

December - Early February
The height of summer provide daylight stretching out to nearly 24 hours. King penguins and their fluffy brown chicks crowd the colonies in South Georgia, while other penguin species are ever vigilant for nearby feeding leopard seals. Elephant seals suckle their pups (weaners) while the Weddell seals moult ashore. While you're on deck, keep an eye out for arriving humpback whales and their bubble-net feeding technique.

Mid February - Late March
Summer youngsters continue to grow and learn; penguin chicks fledge and run the leopard seal gauntlet while cormorant chicks learn to fly. South Georgia is alive with thousands of fur seal pups and albatross chicks hatch. Whilst the days begin to get shorter and colder, this brings with brilliant sunsets and the return of floating sea ice.
