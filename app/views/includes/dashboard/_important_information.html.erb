    <span>Mandatory Travel Insurance:</span>
    <p>
      Travel insurance is mandatory for all iExpedition clients; if you are unclear about travel insurance please contact us so we can ensure that you have the correct coverage.
      Your travel insurance must cover you for emergency & medical repatriation from the region you are travelling, to an appropriate value. Usually Platinum credit cards coverage will be sufficient, however you will need to further clarify this with your financial institution.
      If you are booking more than 365 days from your departure, we recommend that you a) take out a Deposit/Cancellation Policy or b) use a provider like Covermore Insurance who will issue travel insurance policies 18 months from departure.

    <span>Important:</span>
    <p>
      Please do bear in mind that if your expedition booking is in USD and you would like to pay your final balance in AUD, you will need to check with iExpedition on the day you intend to process your payment(s) for our exchange rate of the day. As we do not convert our expedition product into currencies other than provided by the operator, the onus is on the client to be aware of the exchange rate between the booking currency and their local currency.

      You can remove any currency risk by paying in full at any time. Further to this, a small number of expedition operators offer currency incentive programs, when your pay in full shortly after deposit. If you are interested in knowing more, please check with us to see if your vessel offers such incentive.

      Expedition operators reserve the right to impose a fuel surcharge.

      Your final payment is due 95 â€“ 125 prior to your embarkation date. Please note if your expedition is confirmed with either Quark Expedition or One Ocean Expeditions your final payment is due 125 prior to embarkation.

      Finally please ensure that you read iExpedition Terms & Conditions prior to departure, as well as all expedition documentation in your user dashboard.

      If you have any questions/queries about your expedition or travelling to and from your expedition, please call us on 1800 950 577 or email us at reservations@iexpedition.com and we will be most happy to help you.
