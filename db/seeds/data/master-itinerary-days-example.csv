"Falkland Is, South Georgia & Antarctica (20 Days)",18-Oct-17,6-Nov-17,Akademic Ioffe,One Ocean Expeditions ,Ushuaia; Embarkation Day,"Our exploration of the Falklands, South Georgia and Antarctica commences in Ushuaia. Excitement is in the air as we board the ship, enjoy a welcome cocktail and dinner and cast off for the adventure of a lifetime.

On this voyage, our days are spent exploring on shore in the company of expert guides – including naturalists, marine biologists, ornithologists and adventurers as well as our resident photography professional. Cruising in our inflatable Zodiac boats is another memorable activity. For the adventurers, we provide plenty of opportunities to explore on long hikes ashore, or by sea kayak.",1
"Falkland Is, South Georgia & Antarctica (20 Days)",18-Oct-17,6-Nov-17,Akademic Ioffe,One Ocean Expeditions ,At Sea,"Sailing northeast towards the Falkland Islands we are joined by hundreds of seabirds including the wandering albatross.

"Falkland Is, South Georgia & Antarctica (20 Days)",18-Oct-17,6-Nov-17,Akademic Ioffe,One Ocean Expeditions ,Falkland Islands,"Having arrived in the Falkland’s overnight, we plan to explore several locations in the West Falkland archipelago. These remote islands are home to a proliferation of seabirds and migratory birds including the stunning black-browed albatross. We see our first penguins of the trip on these islands, which could include West Point with its bustling rookeries of rockhoppers. On Carcass Island, we observe nesting Magellanic penguins as well as oystercatchers, geese and the striated caracara – a bird of prey. The following morning we arrive in Stanley, the capital of the Falklands Islands. Wandering through the quiet streets we learn how Stanley was a major port in the 19th century for the tall clipper ships rounding Cape Horn.",3

"Falkland Is, South Georgia & Antarctica (20 Days)",18-Oct-17,6-Nov-17,Akademic Ioffe,One Ocean Expeditions ,South Georgia ,"The island of South Georgia has often been called the ‘Serengeti of the Southern Ocean’ – and as we approach the deep bays of this rugged, rocky outcrop you begin to see why. Launching the Zodiacs we begin our exploration of the island in the vicinity of Elsehul Bay. Large numbers of fur seals and the much larger elephant seal line the beaches. Living in the tussock grass, king penguins and their chicks may number up to 100,000 birds in some locations, including Salisbury Plains, St Andrews Bay and Gold Harbor. The island is also home to large numbers of nesting albatross and they fill the skies above. South Georgia is a thrilling location for history buffs as the rusting relics of the early whaling industry are all around us. A highlight is a visit to Grytviken – the largest of the former whaling stations on the island, and where we visit the gravesite of Shackleton, buried here in 1921. For many, being in the presence of the great explorer is a highlight of the trip. There’s an excellent museum at Grytviken, maintained by the South Georgia Heritage Trust and the restored church, built by the original Norwegian whalers, is another highlight.",7

This morning the magnificent snowy peaks are laid out before us. It’s a a truly awesome sight. The waterways of the Antarctic Peninsula are home to deep bays, pristine coves and inlets and numerous small islands. The Gerlache coastline features heavily glaciated mountains permanently covered in ice and snow. Rocky outcrops are home to gentoo, adelie and chinstrap penguin rookeries and the waters are rich in marine life. 

We frequently encounter seals, including the powerful leopard seal. Curious humpback whales and the smaller minke whales are present much of the time as they feed on the vast schools of krill. Sightings of orca are not uncommon. 

Every day we plan an exciting range of activities including guided hikes on shore and visits to wildlife colonies with our expert naturalist guides. The historic huts and science stations located along the peninsula provide a fascinating glimpse into the past and potential future. Zodiac cruising among the ice searching for seals and whales is amemorable activity. Meanwhile, the sea kayakers may range several miles from the ship. Our resident photography guide will be on hand to help you with your camera setting and image composition. 

Somewhere along this stretch of coastline we plan a night on shore, camping in Antarctica. We have all the right gear and equipment and an expert team to make it happen - all you need is an adventurous spirit!",4

You can anticipate wildlife viewing, visits to scientific bases and historic sites, as well as the spectacular white and blue scenery.

We hope to visit the following areas:
Cape Adare: A large flat spit of land, teeming with the staggering sight of Antarctica’s largest Adelie Penguin rookery: a tumult of chattering, feeding chicks; territorial disputes; petty pilfering and courtship displays. Curious penguins often come very close, offering superb photographic opportunities. Among the shifting mass of penguins we will find 

Carsten Borchgrevink’s Hut, the oldest in Antarctica, an overwintering shelter for the first expedition to the Antarctic continent in 1899.

Cape Hallett: The enormous Admiralty Range heralds our arrival; wild and extraordinary, the mountains rear up from the sea to over 4,000m, bounded by colossal glaciers. We land at an abandoned base site, now home to large numbers of Adelie Penguins and Weddell Seals.

Franklin Island: Desolately beautiful and rugged, this is home to a large Adelie Penguin population and other nesting seabirds. We attempt a landing and explore the coastline.

Possession Islands: Rarely-visited, small and rugged, these rocks support tens of thousands of penguins. Observe the birds’ busy and humorous activity, with the Admiralty Mountains forming a superb backdrop across the water.

Ross Ice Shelf: The world’s largest body of floating ice and a natural barrier, at times creating hazardous weather, with sheets of snow blown at gale force by winds off the polar ice cap. Just 800 miles from the South Pole, this daunting spectacle prevented many early explorers from venturing further south. We cruise along its dizzying 30m high ice cliffs, perhaps lucky enough to see icebergs ‘calving’.

Ross Island: Mount Erebus/Cape Bird/Shackleton’s Hut/Scott’s Hut(s) and visits to a scientific field station (Scott and McMurdo Stations are high on our wish list but ice, weather and station operational requirements often make them inaccessible). Ross Island was and is the ‘hub of activity’ in the Ross Sea, dominated by Mt Erebus, a monstrous active volcano named after the ancient Greek God of Darkness. The carefully preserved huts of the ‘Heroic Era’ help make the history come alive. If we can reach the bases we get a modern perspective on Antarctic Research.

We hope to visit the following areas:
Cape Adare: A large flat spit of land, teeming with the staggering sight of Antarctica’s largest Adelie Penguin rookery: a tumult of chattering, feeding chicks; territorial disputes; petty pilfering and courtship displays. Curious penguins often come very close, offering superb photographic opportunities. Among the shifting mass of penguins we will find 

Carsten Borchgrevink’s Hut, the oldest in Antarctica, an overwintering shelter for the first expedition to the Antarctic continent in 1899.

Cape Hallett: The enormous Admiralty Range heralds our arrival; wild and extraordinary, the mountains rear up from the sea to over 4,000m, bounded by colossal glaciers. We land at an abandoned base site, now home to large numbers of Adelie Penguins and Weddell Seals.

Franklin Island: Desolately beautiful and rugged, this is home to a large Adelie Penguin population and other nesting seabirds. We attempt a landing and explore the coastline.

Possession Islands: Rarely-visited, small and rugged, these rocks support tens of thousands of penguins. Observe the birds’ busy and humorous activity, with the Admiralty Mountains forming a superb backdrop across the water.

Ross Ice Shelf: The world’s largest body of floating ice and a natural barrier, at times creating hazardous weather, with sheets of snow blown at gale force by winds off the polar ice cap. Just 800 miles from the South Pole, this daunting spectacle prevented many early explorers from venturing further south. We cruise along its dizzying 30m high ice cliffs, perhaps lucky enough to see icebergs ‘calving’.

Ross Island: Mount Erebus/Cape Bird/Shackleton’s Hut/Scott’s Hut(s) and visits to a scientific field station (Scott and McMurdo Stations are high on our wish list but ice, weather and station operational requirements often make them inaccessible). Ross Island was and is the ‘hub of activity’ in the Ross Sea, dominated by Mt Erebus, a monstrous active volcano named after the ancient Greek God of Darkness. The carefully preserved huts of the ‘Heroic Era’ help make the history come alive. If we can reach the bases we get a modern perspective on Antarctic Research.

Terra Nova Bay: An Italian research station where the scientists are always hospitable and enjoy showing us around their lonely but beautiful home. They share with us their scientific research and also, perhaps, the best ‘cafe espresso’ in Antarctica!",18

We hope to navigate the ship into the historic location of King Haakon Bay. It was here that, 100 years ago, Shackleton and his men made landfall in their small lifeboat, the James Caird, after completing the perilous ocean crossing from Elephant Island. This dramatic location is visited by just a handful of ships each season. 

One of the most anticipated sites in South Georgia is Salisbury Plain. The black sand beaches and tussock covered dunes are home to a staggering 100,000 penguin adults and their young. This is just one of several such king penguin rookeries on South Georgia. Fur seals can also be seen poking their heads above the water; the elephant seals will enjoy lazing about the beach, while the skuas and giant petrels fill the skies above. Meanwhile, the albatross - our constant companion on this journey - is never far away. History comes into sharp focus as we visit Stromness and Grytviken. 

From 1912 until the 1930’s, these locations acted as whaling stations. Today, the rusted and ghostly remnants seem out of place in such a pristine environment. If the weather co-operates, we hope to be able to hike the last few miles across the saddle separating Fortuna Bay from neighboring Stromness, following the footsteps of Shackleton, Crean and Worsley. As we journey further to the southeast we enter the broad expanse of Cumberland Bay. At the head of the bay lies Grytviken – the largest of the old whaling stations on South Georgia.

One of the most anticipated sites in South Georgia is Salisbury Plain. The black sand beaches and tussock covered dunes are home to a staggering 100,000 penguin adults and their young. This is just one of several such king penguin rookeries on South Georgia. Fur seals can also be seen poking their heads above the water; the elephant seals will enjoy lazing about the beach, while the skuas and giant petrels fill the skies above. Meanwhile, the albatross - our constant companion on this journey - is never far away. History comes into sharp focus as we visit Stromness and Grytviken. 

From 1912 until the 1930’s, these locations acted as whaling stations. Today, the rusted and ghostly remnants seem out of place in such a pristine environment. If the weather co-operates, we hope to be able to hike the last few miles across the saddle separating Fortuna Bay from neighboring Stromness, following the footsteps of Shackleton, Crean and Worsley. As we journey further to the southeast we enter the broad expanse of Cumberland Bay. At the head of the bay lies Grytviken – the largest of the old whaling stations on South Georgia.

Rocky outcrops are home to gentoo, adelie and chinstrap penguin rookeries and the waters are rich in marine life. We frequently encounter seals, including the powerful leopard seal, usually found hauled out on an ice floe. Curious humpback whales and the smaller minke whales are present much of the time as they feed on the vast schools of krill. Sightings of orca are not uncommon. 

Our activity program is in full swing and we encourage all guests to choose how their adventure unfolds. Every day we plan an exciting range of activities, including guided hikes on shore (both short and long), visits to wildlife colonies with our expert naturalist guides, as well as Zodiac cruising. 

The historic huts and science stations located along the peninsula provide a fascinating glimpse into the past and the present.

This voyage is a real sailing trip that involves the sailing between our destinations and finally crossing

also enjoy the lecture program put together by our guides and crew for the whole trip. Some subjects
covered during these talks are about the rigging, the lines, the different sails, navigation concepts
and rope work. During the natural history talks you will learn to see the difference between various species
of birds, including the mighty albatrosses, like the Black-browed, Wandering and Light Mantled
Sooty Albatross.

the names: “Roaring Forties”, “Furious Fifties” and “Screaming Sixties” corresponding with the degrees
of latitude. Sailing from one destination to the next gives you the time to experience all the aspects of
seaman’s life.

This voyage is a real sailing trip that involves the sailing between our destinations and finally crossing
of the Drake Passage, under sail whenever possible. During the many sailing days, you will be
part of the watch system, fulfilling sailing duties on board: steering, lookout and sail handling. You will
also enjoy the lecture program put together by our guides and crew for the whole trip. Some subjects
covered during these talks are about the rigging, the lines, the different sails, navigation concepts
and rope work. During the natural history talks you will learn to see the difference between various species
of birds, including the mighty albatrosses, like the Black-browed, Wandering and Light Mantled
Sooty Albatross. 

In this way, during the voyage, you will be developing sail handling skills and expanding your knowledge
on wildlife, history, glaciology, meteorology and other topics related with our trip. The Southern Atlantic Ocean is infamous for its roughness, hence
the names: “Roaring Forties”, “Furious Fifties” and “Screaming Sixties” corresponding with the degrees
of latitude. Sailing from one destination to the next gives you the time to experience all the aspects of
seaman’s life.

You will learn to see the difference between the Black browed Albatrosses and Light-mantled Albatrosses.
