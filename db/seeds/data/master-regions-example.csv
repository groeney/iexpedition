Antarctic Peninsula,"The Antarctic Peninsula offers the perfect stepping stone for us to explore and experience the wonders of this mysterious continent. Stretching up, to nearly touch South America, the Antarctic Peninsula offers so many incredible experiences.

Only a 2 day sail (weather dependent) from Argentina/Chile or a 2 hour flight, there is a multitude of ways to access the Antarctic Peninsula. With so many natural highlights, unique geological formations and geography, you can be assured your time in and around the Antarctic Peninsula will not disappoint you.

Our expeditions to the Antarctic Peninsula and surrounds travel from late-October through until late-March. Over the course of this period there are distinct seasons, you should give consideration to these, based on your travel preferences and what highlights are important to you.",Antarctica
Antarctic Circle ,,Antarctica 
South Shetland Islands,"The South Shetland Island comprise of around 20 islands, lying around 120km north of the Antarctic Peninsula, they are separated by the Bransfield Strait. This region of Antarctica, is certainly more temperate than the Antarctica Peninsula, with temperatures ranging from -10° - +5° and it was here that Shackleton&rsquo;s men waited, while he set off on his South Georgia expedition.

For all most every expedition voyage, the islands will be the first sign of the Antarctic landscape. There are many significant islands like Deception and Elephant Islands, which depending on the conditions around your voyage, you may stop at. Due to the Islands temperate conditions, wildlife thrives here, each of the Brushtail penguin species (Gentoo, Adelie and Chinstrap) are abundant on the islands, elephant seals, whales and giant petrels also call the South Shetland Islands home too. The Islands provide especially great wildlife opportunities for voyages earlier in the Antarctic season.

Our Fly/Cruise expedition utilise the Antarctic airfield on King George Island as the hub for the arrival and departure flights between Antarctica and Punta Arenas, Chile.",Antarctica 
South Georgia,"South Georgia is one of the true wildlife Mecca&rsquo;s on our planet, often the wildlife displays here are referred to as the greatest on Earth. Set amongst awe inspiring scenery, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine how early pioneers survived in this harsh landscape. Wildlife on South Georgia is non-migratory, due to its reasonable temperate conditions, it is home to the largest breeding sites for Wandering Albatross and King Penguins found anywhere in the world. Here King Penguin rookeries stretch up mountains and number hundreds of thousands of birds.

During the breeding months, the courtship displays of the Wandering Albatross, King Penguins and the fierce Elephant Seals create for a marvel of Attenborough proportions. Whaling on the island has long since finished and there are great opportunities for sightings, especially as you near the Antarctic convergence.",Antarctica
Falkland Islands,"The Falkland Islands, remain disputed territory, they certainly should not be forgot about. As they feature rugged scenery and excellent wildlife opportunities, including the Black-browed albatross, Elephant seals and a number of penguin species not found in Antarctica.",Antarctica
Weddell Sea ,"The Weddell Sea is often a forgotten region of the Antarctic Peninsula, few humans venture here each season.. Voyages to the Weddell Sea will explore both the East and West Coasts of the Peninsula and offer a more diverse Antarctic experience.

Weddell Sea voyages are slightly longer than the standard Antarctic Peninsula voyages to allow for exploration of both sides of the Antarctic Peninsula. Taking in the wildlife rich West Coast, your expedition will head into the Weddell Sea (East Coast), the wild and remote side of the Peninsula. Home to massive glaciers and tabular icebergs, an underwater volcano and wildlife-rich islands, it is here that the 
Antarctic Peninsula's icebergs calve, breakup and set adrift from.

These voyages provide a combination of wildlife, coupled with varying landscape and geological formations. If you have interest in the landscape and natural beauty, as much as wildlife, we would certainly recommend these voyages.",Antarctica
South Sandwich Islands,"This remote archipelago consists of 11 primary islands of volcanic origin. The rugged coastlines of these islands make it extremely difficult place to visit, let alone make it a shore, each year only a handful of our expeditions will be fortunate to land at any of these islands.",Antarctica 
Ross Sea,"Departing from Hobart, Australian and Bluff (Invercargill), New Zealand these are true expeditions, to a region of Antarctica revered by a select few expeditions each year and often referred to as the Real Antarctica.

At 66.9°S Commonwealth Bay and the Ross Sea at 74.5°S are separated from Australia and New Zealand by some XXX nautical miles of open ocean, you certainly earn your right to explore this region of Antarctica after crossing the Southern Ocean. The crossing each way, will be broken up with time spent on the sub-Antarctic Islands of Macquarie, Snares, Auckland and Campbell.

This deep south region of Antarctica is bathed in some of the finest expeditions of the heroic era. The race for the South Pole, between Amundsen and Scott played out in this region, which Amundsen was to eventually win, while Scott perished. Commonwealth Bay is home to the Huts of Sir Douglas Mawson at Cape Denison and is a region steeped in Australian Antarctic History, through the 1911-14 Australian Antarctic Expedition. The region is also home to the Emperor penguins and we hope to see these magnificent birds at sea and on ice floes.",Antarctica

Sub-Antarctic Islands,"Australia and New Zealand's sub-Antarctic islands are a wonderland of rugged landscapes, birds, penguins and seals. Little known and often forgotten about for the likes of South Georgia, these islands present a very similar experience.

Macquarie Island in particular, is home to the Wandering Albatross, King Penguins and Elephant seal colonies of wild proportions. The island wildlife and scientific sanctuary and tourism in this region is governed strictly. The New Zealand sub-Antarctic islands are made up of Auckland, Snares, Campbell, Bounty, Chatham and the little known Antipodes Island. These islands are rarely visited and in a number of instances our expeditions to these islands are the only ones permitted.

They are the perfect expedition, for anyone who has been to the Antarctic Peninsula and missed the opportunity to visit South Georgia or for nature and bird lovers, not so keen on the long open water crossings to Antarctica.

These voyages operate from November through until January and range in duration from 8 - 19 days , all voyages depart Bluff, New Zealand.",Antarctica 
EUROPEAN ARCTIC,"From the windswept coastline of Scotland, alive at this time of the year with seabird colonies nesting, to the Norwegian coastline dotted with historic waterfront towns, huge bird colonies, towering mountains and world famous fjords that will take your breath away. Sitting high above the Arctic Circle, the island archipelago of Svalbard home to lush tundra, Arctic seabirds, walrus, the mighty polar bears, active glaciers and delicate flora; these incredible islands offer sweeping landscapes and an abundance of wildlife. Carved from massive icebergs, Greenland lies halfway between Svalbard and Iceland, she is a land of history and legends, immense fjord systems, rich culture and magnificent scenery.

Northeast Passage & Wrangle Island,"Russia controls one of the greatest seaways in the world. Whilst in Russia it is known as the Northern Sea Route, the rest of the world usually refer to it as the Northeast Passage. Only a handful of expedition vessels have ever transited this seaway, but recent changes in the summer sea ice conditions mean this historic and fascinating sea route is now accessible to a few suitably constructed expedition vessels. The indigenous peoples of the north coast of Siberia were undoubtedly familiar with sections of this seaway but it wasn't until 1878-1880 that Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiold completed the first ever transit. Earlier attempts to find a route in the 16th century had been thwarted by either ice or politics or both. Our epic journey will commence from Murmansk in Russia, following the route east towards Anadyr. Along the way your itinerary may attempt landings at Franz Josef Land, the Severnaya Zemyla archipelago and the High Arctic Russian Nature Reserve on Wrangel Island, as well as many other rarely visited sites.

Canadian Arctic,"The Canadian Arctic is well known for its diverse wildlife, rich native culture and spectacular scenery. For those seeking the truly remote, an expedition deep within the Arctic Circle offers a taste of pure adventure.

The Canadian Arctic refers to the northernmost reaches of the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Canada's largest and newest territory, Nunavut. With a relatively small population of around 100,000, residing above the Arctic Circle.

Ellesmere Island National Park covers the northern tip of this remote island, which boasts a landscape of vast untouched wilderness, fjords, glaciers and icecaps, culminating at Cape Columbia, the most northerly point of North America. The stark beauty of the interior's mountainous terrain is truly awe-inspiring.

To the south is the smaller Cornwallis Island, where you will find one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, Resolute. A small Inuit community on the south coast, with a population of just 200.

Immense Baffin Island is Canada's largest island and the fifth largest in the world. Baffin Island's south coast fringes the Hudson Strait, separating the island from Québec. Wildlife can be found throughout the High Arctic, including Arctic fox, polar bear, Arctic wolf, barren-ground caribou and the Arctic hare.
